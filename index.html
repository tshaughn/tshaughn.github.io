        <h2>Problem statement: Trouble finding mentors</h2>
        <p>
        Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to go in.
          Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find internships and research opportunites.

          Description of Affinity Diagram: With the following ideas and solutions, we can make the app helpful to students. People from universities will never 
          have trouble finding mentors, when they can access one to meet with on our app. If we perform everything according to plan,
          it is expected that the app will prosper.

            My individual likes to play a lot of tennis and goes to the gym in his free time. He values the idea 
            of working hard to get to his goals in both athletics and academics. He looks forward to having good
            mentors that will challenge him, while also making him learn well.

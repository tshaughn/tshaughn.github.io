        <h2>Problem statement: Trouble finding mentors</h2>
        <p>
        Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to go in.
          Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find internships and research opportunites.

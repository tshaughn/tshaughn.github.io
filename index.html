        <h2>Problem statement: Trouble finding mentors</h2>
        <p>
        Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to go in.
          Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find internships and research opportunites.

        <p>
          With the following ideas and solutions, we can make the app helpful to students. People from universities will never 
          have trouble finding mentors, when they can access one to meet with on our app. If we perform everything according to plan,
          it is expected that the app will prosper.

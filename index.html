        <h2>Problem statement: Trouble finding mentors</h2>
        <p>
        Students and young adults have a hard time finding mentors and getting advice from people in the industry they want to go in.
          Getting connections and networking is hard for many students. Which makes it hard for them to find internships and research opportunites.

          Description of Affinity Diagram: With the following ideas and solutions, we can make the app helpful to students. People from universities will never 
          have trouble finding mentors, when they can access one to meet with on our app. If we perform everything according to plan,
          it is expected that the app will prosper.

            My individual likes to play a lot of tennis and goes to the gym in his free time. He values the idea 
            of working hard to get to his goals in both athletics and academics. He looks forward to having good
            mentors that will challenge him, while also making him learn well.

          <p>
              In this scenario, Dylan is struggling with calculus. To try solving this, he goes on the internet,
              and finds our mentor app. He then schedules an appointment with a calculus mentor named Jessica. They
              meet up and she helps him with his calculus. At the end, he gets an A+ because he can finally succeed
              in calculus.

          <p>
          My sketch features a customer looking through the different paths of being mentored. My customer picked Math
          since he is needing a Calculus tutor. My customer then hits the Calculus I option. This brings up a screen 
          that shows him the different mentor that he can choose from. He can then see each mentor's profile. He can then
          also chat with his mentor to schedule an appointment.

        <p>
        My team members and I created a paper prototype planning out how the different 
        screen would interact with one another for our app, now called "Mentor Hub".
